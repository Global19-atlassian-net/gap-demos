# Welcome to GAP Jupyter notebooks!

This repository contains a collection of examples of using GAP in Jupyter.
Follow links from <https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/gap-demos/blob/master/Index.ipynb>
to other notebooks in this collection to see their content rendered on GitHub.

To explore this collection further, in particular to see the graphical elements
that are not rendered by the GitHub notebooks viewer, you need to open these 
notebooks in Jupyter. You can do this locally in your clone of this repository,
or remotely by running them on Binder (<https://mybinder.org/>).

To launch these notebooks in an executable environment on Binder, perform
the following steps:

1. Click on one of the "launch binder" badges above, selecting the
version of GAP which you need.

2. First "Loading repository: OpenDreamKit/gap-demos/..." will be 
displayed, followed by a non-interactive preview. When the environment
will be ready, you will see the index file with the content of this
repository.

3. Click on a link to another GAP Jupyter notebook to open it.
You should be able to run the code in the notebook, e.g. by executing one cell
after another, or by running all cells, and perform other actions, e.g. add
new cells to the notebook, or start a new notebook. Your changes will not be
preserved after the window will be closed, but you should be able to download
the notebook in various formats. For further information about Jupyter, see 
<https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>.
